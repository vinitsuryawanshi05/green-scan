            <h2>Scientific Name: Pongamia pinnata</h2>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Karanj Tree, also known as Indian Beech, is a medium-sized, fast-growing deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It has a wide-spreading crown, glossy pinnate leaves, and small clusters of fragrant purplish flowers. The tree produces oil-rich seeds known as karanj seeds, which are widely used in traditional medicine and for biodiesel production. It also plays an important role in agroforestry and soil restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
