            <h2>Scientific Name: Areca catechu</h2>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Betel Nut Palm, also known as the Areca Palm or Supari tree, is a slender, tropical palm tree native to South and Southeast Asia. It produces the well-known betel nuts, which are actually seeds of its fruit. The tree is tall with a smooth, ringed trunk and a crown of feathery, arching leaves. It is commonly cultivated for its nuts, which are chewed in many Asian cultures for their stimulant effects.</p>

            <h2>Care Tips:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Water: Requires consistent moisture, especially when young. Do not let the soil dry out completely. Avoid waterlogging.</li>
                <li>Light: Prefers full sun to partial shade. Ideal for tropical or warm climates where sunlight is abundant.</li>
                <li>Temperature: Thrives in hot, humid conditions between 70째F to 95째F (21째C to 35째C). It is not frost-tolerant.</li>
                <li>Humidity: Needs high humidity. Misting the leaves or growing in naturally humid areas helps the plant stay healthy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Medicinal Uses:</h2>
            <p>Betel nut from the Areca Palm has been used in traditional medicine and cultural practices for centuries.
