            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Gamhar Tree, also known as Gmelina or Gumhar, is a fast-growing deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It is commonly used in agroforestry and timber production due to its straight trunk and quality wood. The tree has large, heart-shaped leaves and bears trumpet-shaped yellow flowers with purple markings. It is valued not only for its wood but also for its ecological and medicinal benefits.</p>
